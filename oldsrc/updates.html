            Moved difficulty settings to the options menu
        </li>
        <li>

    <h3>Patch notes 1.7.4</h3>
    <h4 class="green">Additions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each race will get starting weapon when created. This is more or less based on that race, for example Sylph will start with staff, while Giant with Axe. This should help you at the beginning, and you don't need to kill multiple enemies to get your first weapon to use weapon skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added mana cost to skills, this should make "attack" button somehow useful, for some of the characters until you get mana regen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increased few passive skills max level.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added new passive skills which increase/give chance to: "accuracy, damage, ignore enemy defense, instant kill, critical chance, critical damage, strength, endurance, agility, spell power, max mana, mana regen, defense, parry(nulify 100% damage), thorns aura(deal damage to enemy based on enemy damage), ignore enemy defense, evasion, hp regen, max hp, reflect(chance to reduce incoming damage by 50%), mining/herbalism amount, storage(max amount of ores/herbs you can store), mining/herbalism critical chance(if you are lucky, you can gain bonus resources each time you mine)".
        </li>
        <li>
            Removed passive skills: "Exp/Gold/Drop rate, few damage bonus/health bonus passives. Changed some of the old passive bonuses/levels etc."
        </li>
        <li>
            Added a simple animation when attacking(This will cause your character to move a little towards the enemy).
        </li>
        <li>
            Spell power is used with staff spells currently.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="orange">Changes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Crafting items is based on level of the last enemy you have killed. This will prevent crafting too strong items.
        </li>
        <li>
            Base accuracy lowered from 95% to 90%.
        </li>
        <li>
            Item bonuses will be weaker and more random.
        </li>
        <li>
            Player damage changed to make it easier at the beginning, and monsters damage increased. Monsters hp lowered a little.
        </li>
        <li>
            All items, should be much weaker after each "Warp".
        </li>
        <li>
            Decreased enemy experience gained per kill.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spell Simulacrum(last skill in staff weapon mastery tree), increase spell power, instead of intelligence. Since spell power is based on intelligence anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sylph all stat bonus change from 30% to 15%, but will also gain 20% spell power bonus.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="red">Bug Fixes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed most bugs with displaying numbers like "1.000000002". Hopefully it is fixed everywhere :)
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Patch notes 1.7.3</h3>
    <h4 class="green">Additions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Item tooltip, now display values gained(green), lost(red), not changed(blue) when hovering over an item. This should make it easier to equip best item you can.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="orange">Changes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Turn based combat, your weapon skills need to be used during combat, this is early version of combat, so it is not finished yet, but it should work :)
        </li>
        <li>
            Removed auto battle, due to new combat(might be added later on).
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, changed all weapon skill stats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Health regen, works only in battle(per turn), after a battle your health will be full again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increased height of inventory, this will prevent page moving up while you sell items, which caused you to missclick and equip items. This problem is still there, if you have a lot items in your inventory and you sell them from the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
            Moved some stuff around, put donation button to a visible spot(it was there for a long long time, but well hidden lol).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="red">Bug Fixes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As always, some bugs were fixed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Patch notes 1.7.2</h3>
    <h4 class="green">Additions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added "prestige", after defeating last enemy on the map(once), all enemies will be empowered, and you will need to fight your way from the first enemy.
            All items, crafting, enemy stats will get multiplied by prestige level, so first prestige gives 2x multiplier, then 3x/4x and so on forever...
        </li>
        <li>
            Added reset button(after beating last enemy), so you can reset whenever you want.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added error tracking, which will let me see all errors you have during the game. So far most of them are caused by OLD SAVES(You need to reset them at starting page).  
            I will be removing all saves manually soon, as it seems not everyone knows that :| Also game version verify is not always working for some reason(probably on very old saves).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="orange">Changes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Many changes with item stats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Forced reset, since a lot of peoples had troubles with manual reset, even tho there is a button on main page to do that for you. This will hopefully fix most bugs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="red">Bug Fixes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed some bugs, and stuff -_-
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed a bug which did not reset monsters kill count as supposed.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Patch notes 1.7.1</h3>
    <h4 class="green">Additions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Monster kill count below all monsters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alt + Click = 10 stats for MAC users, Ctrl + click still works.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added 6 difficulty settings! You can switch them while you play and monsters will be updated. Monster stats will change in range 0.3 up to 5.0(that means 5x all stats/Exp too!).
        </li>
        <li>
            Added version check(again after a long time...). It will reset any save file that is too old, when you try to load it.

    </ul>
    <h4 class="orange">Changes</h4>
    <ul>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Changed item drop stats, they should be more balanced, and less likely skyrocket in stats early in the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            Player experience required for next level updated.
        </li>
        <li>
            All races bonuses changed. Hopefully Giant/Orc will no longer be the only viable pick :)
        </li>
        <li>
            Each weapon type(Sword/Axe/Mace/Staff/Ranged) have different damage multiplier, which means that staff will roll with low damage, while axe will have high damage.

            Removed Evasion/Critical damage/Health regen/Mana regen from all items.
        </li>
        <li>
            Item stats are based on item level, unlike before they were based on a list of stats with a set range(3-8 Strength/8-15 Strength etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
            Item stats were maxed out at level 50, now you can increase them forever, as long as you can drop higher level items.
        </li>
        <li>
            You cannot select text/images or anything while playing, this will prevent accidental and annoying text selection which cannot be unselected or is hard to do so.
            You can still select your save code tho.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changed defense damage reduction, should be somehow "balanced" compared to before.

        </li>
        <li>
            Block chance is capped at 40%, sword mastery can go over this cap tho.
        </li>
        <li>
            Removed game events, need to be reworked later on.
        </li>
        <li>

            First weapon skill is available at level 1. You can use staff right away without leveling it up etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Weapon mastery starts at level 1 instead of 0.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changed difficulty setting names.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="red">Bug Fixes</h4>

        <li>
            Fixed a bug with stats, which were multiplied by 2 for some reason :|

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
